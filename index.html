  <h1>PopProjects Bio</h1>

  <p>
    PopProjects is a small but creative web development group that specializes in building retro, fun, and simple websites. We’re not a huge team, but we love creating unique, lighthearted web experiences using the basics of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our goal is to bring a touch of nostalgia to the web, while keeping things simple, entertaining, and easy to use
  </p>

  <p>
    At PopProjects, we focus on crafting websites that are fun, quirky, and easy to navigate. We’re not about high-tech complexity – we love creating websites that remind you of the early days of the internet, with playful designs and straightforward functionality
  </p>
